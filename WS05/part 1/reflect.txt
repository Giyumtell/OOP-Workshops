Workshop: 5  Reflection
=================================================================================================================================
In this workshop, I was able to practice defining template classes and allocate and deallocate memory for those templated
 classes. then I learnt how to use pointers to functions and design function objects after this I had to code a lambda 
expression to modify a value inside my class and I think it is very useful and handy.
I still need to study the member function that receives the address of a callback function because it is still confusing
 to me and finally implementing error handling and managing exceptions was also a good practice to make a crash-free app.
