Workshop: 2  Reflection
=================================================================================================================================
In this workshop i was able to practice allocating memory using std::string to recieve any amount of strings from a file
and store it in memory then i implemented the rule of 3 and had to implement the copy constructor and assignment constructor
to be able to copy the data and have no memory leak and then i could see how long does it take for copy and assignment to
process data and it actually took some time! then after implementing move semantics which moves out data instead of copying
it using Rvalue, it took way less to do the same task!
