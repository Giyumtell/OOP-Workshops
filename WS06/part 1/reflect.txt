Workshop: 6  Reflection
=================================================================================================================================
in this workshop i was able to use Vectors to store my data and iterate through it.
after allocating memory i had to deallocate that memory because vector is only a container for the addresses of those objects
and it requires deleting to prevent memory leak.
we could have a checker or validator that goes through all the data and checks for wrong records and throws correct exceptions
using asterisk determines that we want a container for pointers not the actual data
