In this workshop i was able to practice allocating memory For pointer Especially for an array of pointers and how to uase the same 
block of memory and using it's address then i had to use the rule of five and implement destructor, copy constructor,copy assignment
move constructor and move assignment for two of the modules and then i learned how to manage that memory for allocationg and
deallocating and also it was a good example for relations like aggression.
