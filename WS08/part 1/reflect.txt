Workshop: 8  Reflection
=================================================================================================================================
In this week's workshop i was able to use both Raw pointers and smart pointers to implement same functions like += operator
and have a hands on experience on how easier the implementation of smart pointers are and how easy it is to manage memory
using them.
for example in my raw pointer += operator i had to manually call the destructor for first object after moving it to the list
but in the smart pointer syntax all that job was done automatically without any worries.
