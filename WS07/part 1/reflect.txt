=================================================================================================================================
in this workshop i was able to use Vectors and list to store data and use iterators and automatic iteration to search and
sort my data.
i used vector to store the address of each struct that i created for my songs and list to hold those songs. then i used for
loop with iteretor because the size of my vector changes through the program and then i used another loop (for auto &i:x) 
to find an artist. then i used std::sort with lambda expression to sort the vector using a value inside structure.
using stl loops makes it way easier to manage my data rather than manualy doing it and i dont have to think about the size of
my arrays.
