Workshop: 1  Reflection
=================================================================================================================================
In this workshop i was able to learn and practice accepting arguments from command line and have them as conditions
for running my program then setup a guard for my header file since it was called twice and i didnt want to have
duplicate declaration of my class and also i learnt ho to define a variable with a scope of a function and have it 
live until the program ends (static).i think the most trublesome section was the copy assignment and assignment 
operators since it was doing a shallow copy and assigning the pointers to same address so the archive and current
event had same address so when destructor deleted one both were gone and had to implement them.
