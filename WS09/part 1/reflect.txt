When you want to work with data the way it is instead of a text file and have it stored on memory without any change you can use
binary files. it allowed me to store the file which was encrypted on my memory without any interfere from the operating system
and have it restored the way it is. to do so I opened my file as a binary file and allocated memory for it then stored it bit
by bit.
binding function to a wrapper with the right arguments helped me to split my decode/encoder work into multiple threads and made
everything clean and simple.
to use multiple threads in this workshop I split my manually allocated memory into 4 chunks then I split the binary data also
to 4 chunks and bound each part as an argument to my wrapper using std::bind with converter function then made 4 threads and
called each bind with one thread then waited for all of them to finish by using join().
